        <br>
        <p class="gradient-text" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Zonikyo is an Australian Teenager who loves playing Minecraft and stretching the limits when it comes to Computers</p>
        <p class="gradient-text" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">In the past, Zonikyo has created mutliple games using the Scratch programming website, which uses block-based code to create pretty much anything.</p>
        <p class="gradient-text" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Posting these games to his Website, www.codedfun.net, he found a great fan base who loved his ideas. A fan base of Zero people.</p>
        <p class="gradient-text" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">So in 2022, Zonikyo created a YouTube channel "CoolD1234" and started creating Gaming content, Be like videos and other things which he enjoyed.</p>
        <p class="gradient-text" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Zonikyo would post occasionally, throughout 2022 and 2023, but towards the Middle of 2023, there was a new thing he found fun. Livestreaming.</p>
        <p class="gradient-text" style="margin-bottom: 20px;">Ever since, Zonikyo has been livestreaming on Twitch and YouTube, creating new websites that people enjoy... and failing at school... (but we won't talk about that one ok)</p>
